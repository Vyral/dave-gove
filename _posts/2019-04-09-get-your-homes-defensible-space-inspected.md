After a long, brutal, record-breaking winter, not many of us are probably thinking about fire season. Unfortunately, that time of year is coming up, which means it’s time for you to think about your property’s defensible space. &nbsp;

To clarify, **defensible space is the area around your house that you can defend from wildfire,** which can include overhanging tree limbs, dead or dying tree limbs, grass, shrubs, and anything else that can facilitate wildfire coming toward your house.&nbsp;

What does this have to do with real estate? If you’re a seller, the North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District and the Truckee Fire Protection District have mandated that **any home that gets sold must have a defensible space inspection before it closes escrow.** This means you’ll need one of these departments to survey your property to see if anything needs to be corrected.&nbsp;

Any corrections that need to be made don’t have to be completed before the close of escrow, but if you don’t have them taken care of, or at least have a cost estimate for these corrections, the buyer may use that as a negotiation tool.&nbsp;

So, if you’re putting your home on the market soon, check in with your local fire protection district to schedule a defensible space inspection and get a cost estimate so you don’t find yourself at a disadvantage once you get to the negotiating table.&nbsp;
