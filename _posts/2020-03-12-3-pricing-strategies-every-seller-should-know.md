<center><em>Are you realistic with your pricing strategy, or is your head in the clouds?&nbsp;</em></center>

&nbsp;

Here are the three main pricing strategies every seller should know:&nbsp;

**1\. Underpricing.** We could price your home anywhere from 3% to 5% below what comparable homes in your area have recently sold for. This will help you sell your home quickly, and likely for top dollar. Lower asking prices typically generate multiple-offer situations.&nbsp;

There are some risks involved with this strategy, however. If there isn’t a multiple-offer scenario, you may have to end up selling your home for 3% to 5% less than market value. That being said, we do see this strategy net sellers full price or more on their sales most of the time.&nbsp;

**2\. Aspirational pricing.** Pricing your home above its market value is a popular starting point for sellers, but it doesn't always work. Buyers shop by comparison, so if they think your home is overpriced, you might have to reduce the price—possibly below market value to compensate for the initial lack of interest.&nbsp;

**3\. Goldilocks pricing.** Looking at comparable sales in your area is the best way to price your home just right. Typically, listing your home right at or very near its market value is a good way to get your list price, or at least something satisfactorily close.&nbsp;

There are three market positions your home could fall into based on your pricing strategy. **If you price your home 0% to 3% above comparable prices, you’re in the market;** buyers will be coming back for second looks and showing genuine interest.&nbsp;

**If you price between 3% and 5% above comparable sales, you’re in no man’s land.** This is where the vast majority of listings sit, and they help other homes in the market sell by way of comparison. These homes generate a lot of showings, but not much serious interest. To get out of no man’s land, the average home will have to undergo a price reduction of $10,000 to $15,000.&nbsp;

**If you price your home 5% to 10% above comparable prices, you’re out of the market completely.** It’s actually better to be out of the market than in no man’s land; if you’re dreaming with your price, then at least this way you’ll be dreaming in peace—no one’s coming to see your home\! You don’t have a chance of selling, but at least you won’t be inconvenienced by buyers inquiring about your home\!

As agents, we have the ability to gauge how your property resonates with buyers through our collections system. We can see how many people on Compass.com have pegged yours as a favorite in their home search.&nbsp;

2020 is going to be a great market year, but there will still be some competitiveness on the selling side. If you’re interested in selling your home soon or want to see what price you’d be able to get for it if you did sell, reach out to us by phone or email. We’d love to chat with you.&nbsp;
