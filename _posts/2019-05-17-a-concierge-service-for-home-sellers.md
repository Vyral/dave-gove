The Compass Concierge Program is similar to a concierge service at a hotel: If you’re in a new city and you don’t really know what to do, you can all up the concierge for recommendations. They’ll even make reservations for you, and otherwise help you streamline the process.

Well our Compass Concierge Program is like that, but for home sellers. The program will actually help you to fix your house up to sell; they’ll even provide a list of vendors to make it easier for you to hire them. The great news is that they’ll actually pay for the work to be done.&nbsp;

Mind you, you’ll have to pay them back, but **it’s essentially an interest-free loan that allows you to handle home issues with things like landscaping, painting, driveway repairs, cleaning, etc.,** at the beginning of the project with no money out of your pocket. Once your home sells, the Compass Concierge Program gets paid out of escrow—no points, no fees, not interest, nothing. It can’t get any easier than that\!

You should also keep in mind that I’m a general contractor with 25 years of experience working on homes, so if you’re interested in getting ready to sell your home this season and would like some help, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you out as best I can.
