  Why is a pre-listing home inspection so important? Let me share a real-life
  example of what can happen if sellers neglect to have one done.

  This example is why it’s very important to know the actual condition of your

**It’s absolutely imperative that you know the true value and condition of your home before you put it on the market.** Just today, we closed on a property where I represented the buyer; unfortunately, the seller was not aware of their home’s value.

We negotiated a sales price, got the property under contract, and then we started to do our investigations. During that time, we had Steve Saturno of Saturno Home Inspections come in for a thorough inspection of the entire property.

Typically, a home inspection will reveal a few little things that need to be addressed, like minor repairs or upgrades. In this situation, however, we did find out that **the house had a pretty serious structural defect that the seller hadn’t known about.**

This put us in a very powerful negotiating position: **We were able to negotiate the price of the house down $75,000 from the original asking price**. Now my buyers will be able to go in and do those repairs for approximately half that cost. We’re adding a lot of value and equity right out of the gate.

It’s for this reason that sellers need to have their home pre-inspected before they list it for sale—**failure to do so could result in a massive loss when the sale is complete.**

If you have any questions about the value of your property on today’s market or questions about what certain repairs or upgrades might cost, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to come out to your home for a free, no-obligation consultation.
