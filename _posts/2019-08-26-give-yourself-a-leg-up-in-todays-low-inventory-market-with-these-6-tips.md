If you’re looking to buy a home, but feel discouraged by the lack of available supply in our local market, you aren’t alone. This is a common concern among today’s homebuyers, which is why today I’ve got six key tips that will help you find the perfect home despite our current low inventory:&nbsp;

**1\. Get pre-approved.** Unlike getting pre-qualified, which simply involves a basic phone conversation with a lender, the pre-approval process requires you to prove you are truly capable of purchasing a home within a given price range. So in today’s competitive, low-inventory market, sellers love to see buyers who they know can make good on their offer. Getting pre-approved also helps you narrow your search by giving you a better understanding of the kinds of homes you can afford.&nbsp;**<br><br>2\. Figure out what home features you would like to have versus those you need to have.** Sure, granite countertops would be nice, but it’s important not to let non-essential details prevent you from making an offer on a home that comes with everything you actually need. To make your search a little easier, try writing down a list of “must-have” items and another list of “would-like-to-have” items. This will give you a clearer idea of what features are truly important in a home.&nbsp;<br><br>**3\. Research different neighborhoods.** A great home isn’t enough. The right property should also be in a neighborhood that suits your wants and needs. Therefore, looking into crime statistics, school districts, and local amenities is key. Consider driving around the various neighborhoods you’re considering at different times of day throughout the week to figure out what you could expect from living there.&nbsp;

Too many choices can be stressful, so picking out a single style will help you and your agent to conduct a more focused search.&nbsp;<br><br>**5 . Document your home visits.** After a while, the various homes you’ve toured with your agent can begin to blur together in your mind. To make sure your mental images of these properties don’t become muddled, take notes about the things that stood out to you as soon as you get in your car after a showing.&nbsp;<br><br>**6\. Get pre-approved. (Seriously.)** I know I already pointed this out, but I can’t overstate how important it is. Connect with a lender as soon as you start thinking about searching for homes. You’ll thank yourself later.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: In a high-paced, competitive market, any advantage you can give yourself will be essential to your success in finding your dream home. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
