Receiving more than one offer on your home is exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. I have some great news and some handy tips that will help you make the right choice if you’re deciding between one or more offer:

**1\. Stay organized.** With multiple offers on your plate, it can be difficult to remember which buyer was offering what price and terms. Our team will help you create a spreadsheet for all of your offers so that you can compare them side by side.

**2\. Create a sense of urgency.** Buyers probably already realize that your home is a hot commodity, but it doesn’t hurt to remind them. To incentivize buyers to put their best foot forward, we like to set a deadline by which they must present their highest and best offer. The sense of urgency this creates will ensure you get the best deal for your home.

**3\. Gather information about the buyers.** One of our jobs as your real estate professional is to determine whether the buyers who have submitted offers on the home are capable of going through with the deal. We need to find out what’s motivating their offer.&nbsp;

**4\. Speak with the loan officer behind each offer.** The agent working on behalf of the buyer may not be the most reliable source when it comes to how they characterize their client. They have a vested interest in their success. The loan officer, however, will be happy to offer any insight into the buyer’s financial standing from an unbiased perspective.

**5\. Select one or two backup offers.** After you choose the best offer, don’t cut ties with all the interested buyers. Keep the second and third-best offers in your good graces in case you end up working with them down the line.
