To get a good idea of where our Truckee market is at as we make our way through summer, let’s compare how the first two quarters of this year stack up to last year’s first two quarters (up until May).

Q1 2018:

* There were 146 units listed and 130 units sold
* The average list price was $1,379,039 and the average sale price was $1,312,322, for a list-to-sale price ratio of 95.72%&nbsp;
* The average days on market was 75 days&nbsp;

Q1 2019:&nbsp;

* There were 115 units listed and 94 units sold
* The average list price was $1,445,256 and the average sale price was $1,373,800, for a list-to-sale price ratio of 95.06%&nbsp;
* The average days on market was 75 days

Q2 2018:

* There were 179 units listed and 86 units sold
* The average list price was $1,460,788 and the average sale price was $1,417,474, for a list-to-sale price ratio of 97.03%&nbsp;
* The average days on market was 67 days

Q2 2019:

* There were 183 units listed and 93 units sold
* The average list price was $1,008,559 and the average sale price was $985,306, for a list-to-sale price ratio of 97.69%&nbsp;
* The average days on market was 66 days

Do these figures mean prices are plummeting? I don’t think so. Thus far in June, we’ve had 28 units listed and six units sold. Their average list price was $1,704,166 and their average sale price of $1,000,615 (or an average list-to-sale price ratio of 94.77%). I think we’re going to see more of these bigger sales as we progress throughout the year.&nbsp;

As of right now, we have 197 homes on the market with an average list price of $2,017,362. Here’s how many homes you’ll find in each price range:

* Under $500,000: 14
* $500,000 to $1 million: 75&nbsp;
* $1 million to $1.5 million: 27&nbsp;
* $1.5 million to $2 million: 20
* Over $2 million: 61

If you’re a condo buyer, the breakdown is as follows:

* Under $500,000: 23
* $500,000 to $1 million: 14
* Over $1 million: 12

If you have any questions about these statistics or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
