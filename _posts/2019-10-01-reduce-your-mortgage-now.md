I have a quick tip to share that will help you save big-time when it comes to your mortgage.&nbsp;

There are many types of loans out there, but one thing they all have in common is they’re set for 15- or 30-year terms. I think we all agree that a 15-year term is preferable to a 30-year term, but the problem is that the payments for a shorter term are much higher.&nbsp;

**If you want to reduce a 30-year mortgage to 22 years, then, all you have to do make one extra payment a year.** If you don’t have an extra mortgage payment just lying around that you can spare, you can also pay 1/12th of that payment each month.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

For example, if your monthly mortgage is $2,500 per month, 1/12th of that equates to just $208. If we break it down even further, that’s just $7 per day—$7 per day to shave eight years off your mortgage.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about how to save money on your mortgage or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
