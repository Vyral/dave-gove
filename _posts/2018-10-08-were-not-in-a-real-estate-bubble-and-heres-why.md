Despite some general concern, we are not in a real estate bubble here in the Tahoe/Truckee area.

The reason why is that **we have some of the highest building costs in the entire nation, and this extremely high cost of construction is making it hard for us to have affordable housing.** It’s also making it hard for us to retain skilled labor—tradespeople often end up moving out of our area for a better quality of life.

How did it get this way? A perfect storm of regulatory and legislative building codes. California environmental regulations such as Title 24 mandate that our state has some of the strictest environmental energy and conservation codes in the entire country. Obviously, this is great for the environment, but it makes it more expensive to build a home.

Since we have a lot of earthquakes in California, we also have some of the most stringent structural engineering codes. Additionally, in our area we have to follow the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) building codes, which were enacted several years ago to protect homes against fire storms.

On top of everything else, we have an extraordinarily high cost for building permits. The average permit to build a single-family home costs around $50,000, and a permit for a condominium or townhouse costs around $30,000. That’s before you even stick a shovel in the ground

**I don’t see these costs going down anytime soon**—not unless we change the building codes themselves. With all the talk of international tariffs, I don’t see the price of lumber or steel going down anytime soon either.

Though I don’t think we’re in a bubble, I do think there are some older properties in our market that are overpriced because they’re riding the coattails of recent comparable sales. **If you’re a buyer, now might be the time to make your move**, especially with interest rates ratcheting up as well.

If you’d like to get started on the home buying process or have any other questions about our market, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.
